# flick

A hotkey-summoned grid of everything worth switching to: running windows,
taskbar pins, folders, apps, settings pages, links.

Press `` Alt+` ``. Click a tile. Esc closes and puts you back where you were.

Windows 11 only. `DESIGN.md` for architecture and decisions, `STATUS.md` for
what works and what is next, `CLAUDE.md` for working in this repo.

## Running

```powershell
cargo build
target\debug\flick.exe
```

Starts silent, tray icon only.

Right-click the tray icon:

| Item | Does |
|---|---|
| Show flick | Same as the hotkey |
| Add app… | Browse installed apps, Store apps included, and pin one |
| Add folder… | Pin a folder |
| Add file or shortcut… | Pin a file or `.lnk` |
| Edit settings… | Open `flick.toml` in your editor |
| Exit | Quit |

Log: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\flick\flick.log`

## Config

`flick.toml`, next to the exe. Written with defaults on first run.

**No restart needed.** flick watches the file and reloads on save, hotkey
included. Pins added from the tray are written here, and hand-written comments
and formatting are preserved.

```toml
hotkey = "alt+`"     # ctrl, alt, shift, win + a key
dry_run = false      # true: log what a click would do, do nothing
```

### Sections

Order here is order on screen. Empty sections do not render.

Running things are listed before launchable ones, because switching to something
that exists beats starting something new.

```toml
[[sections]]
title  = "Browsing"
source = "windows"
match  = ["chrome.exe", "msedge.exe", "firefox.exe"]

[[sections]]
title  = "Files"
source = "windows"
match  = ["explorer.exe"]

[[sections]]
title  = "Active"
source = "windows"   # no match: everything not claimed above

[[sections]]
title  = "Launch"
source = "taskbar"   # apps pinned to your Windows taskbar

[[sections]]
title  = "Places"
source = "manual"
items = [
    'R:\dev',
    { title = "Display", target = "ms-settings:display" },
    { title = "Anthropic", target = "https://anthropic.com" },
]
```

`match` lists process names, case-insensitive, and only applies to
`source = "windows"`. Sections claim windows in order and each window is claimed
once, so put filtered sections above the unfiltered catch-all. Keep exactly one
windows section without a `match`, or windows from an unlisted app have nowhere
to go.

Use `'single quotes'` for Windows paths. Inside `"double quotes"` TOML reads `\`
as an escape, so `"R:\dev"` is a parse error.

A manual `target` is anything the shell can open:

| Target | Example |
|---|---|
| Folder | `'R:\dev'` |
| App or file | `'C:\Windows\notepad.exe'` |
| Shortcut | `'C:\...\Thing.lnk'` |
| Store app | `'shell:AppsFolder\<AppUserModelID>'` |
| Settings page | `"ms-settings:display"` |
| Link | `"https://example.com"` |

Bare strings get their title from the path. Use the `{ title, target }` form to
choose one.

### Appearance

Tile size is fixed. It never changes with item count, which is what makes tile
positions learnable. The panel grows outward from center until it hits
`max_screen_fraction` of the monitor, then scrolls.

Defaults fit about 60 tiles on a 1080p monitor. Raise `tile_width` and
`tile_height` if you want fewer, larger ones.

```toml
[grid]
tile_width = 140.0
tile_height = 100.0
gap = 10.0
padding = 18.0
max_screen_fraction = 0.8
max_columns = 9          # hard column cap; 0 means whatever fits
label_height = 24.0
show_detail = false      # true: second line with process name or path
header_height = 22.0     # 0 hides section headers
section_gap = 10.0
corner_radius = 8.0

[theme]
panel = "#F01A1A1E"      # #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB
tile = "#FF2A2A32"
tile_hover = "#FF3C3C48"
text = "#FFE8E8EC"
header = "#FF9A9AA8"
```

## Known gaps

- Taskbar pin **order** is not the taskbar's; entries are sorted by name. The
  real order is an undocumented registry blob. Use a manual section for exact
  control.
- Browser tabs and bookmarks need a browser extension. Not built yet.
- Pinning is via the tray pickers or `flick.toml`. No drag-and-drop, no
  drag-to-reorder, no edit mode yet.
- Window tiles show icons, not live previews.
