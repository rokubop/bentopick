//! Type-to-filter matching. Pure arithmetic on strings, so the rules are
//! testable without a window.
//!
//! Two decisions shape everything here.
//!
//! **Filtering hides, it never reorders.** A tile that survives the query stays
//! in its section, in that section's own order — MRU for windows, the pinned
//! order for the rest. The grid's positions are the thing that makes it
//! learnable (DESIGN.md, "Resolved"), and a list that re-sorts on every
//! keystroke throws that away. The score below exists only to decide which
//! surviving tile the keyboard selection starts on.
//!
//! **Every term must match.** A query splits on whitespace and each term is
//! required, so typing more always narrows. `chr git` finds the Chrome window
//! about a repo, not every Chrome window plus every git one.
//!
//! Matching is prefix and substring only. Subsequence ("fuzzy") matching was
//! left out on purpose: over ~60 tiles it mostly widens the result set with
//! matches the user cannot predict, which is the opposite of what filtering is
//! for here.
